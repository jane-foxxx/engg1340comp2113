# Description:
In the Great Interstellar Era, players in a virtual reality game world were attacked by an unknown virus while using a holographic simulation helmet to play the game. They fail to exit the virtual reality game and are stuck in one new space named the nightmare game.  Players need to follow the guidelines to escape the boundary of this nightmare game before the dawn of the nightmare game. Players who fail to escape before the specified time will fall into death in the real world.

# Game Rule:
When the nightmare game starts, there are forty minutes before dawn coming. Each choice made by the player in the nightmare game will take 5 minutes. 

The initial physical energy value of each player is 5 units. If the physical energy value is lower than 5, the player cannot win the battle with the guard. 

During the game, the player will get useful props in the room, thus deciding how to use the props will be one of the critical factors in successfully escaping the game.

Apart from that, the player also need to decrypt one sentence according to the given information to escape the tower.

# Features to implement:
1.Initialize the int values for time and physical energy
2.
